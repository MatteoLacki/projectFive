# Histogram 3D

The third dimension of this beautifully rendered and multilayered
histogram really gives us the opportunity to look deeper into the
cigarette addiction of our society. Each bar representing a different
segment of employment/education is a visual manifestation of a cigarette, the
darker, burned part of which translates to the current smokers, while the
filter is appropriately related to those who never smoked. 

## Employment

At least half of
each group - except for pupils and students, which are a positive
exception - claimed to have smoked 
at one point in their life. Particularly many smokers are found among
the unemployed and in the private sector and also in those groups
people seem to have a hard time quitting. On the other hand, among the
retirees - which are the largest group on this chart - those who
claimed to have smoked were two times more likely to quit than to have
persisted in this habit. 

## Education

The most smokers can be found in the group of people with technical
education. The most smoke-free group is also the smallest and the most
educated one. That is the people with beyond secondary and university
education. The people with least education - primary or less - also
have a lot of smokers among themselves. It is interesting to note the
correlation between the level of one's education and the ability to
quit smoking. 


# Surface 3D

This colorfully stunning surface graph represents how age and wealth
influence smoking. There were very few people with income above 4000
PLN, so the results were capped there for better clarity. Smoking is
represented as the height of the points of the surface, with a scale
of 1 to 5, which approximates the average number of daily
cigarettes smoked by the respondents. For better readability, this
third dimension is also represented as the color on the surface, going
from red to yellow, as indicated on the axis. The most notable
correlation is with income. People with income around 2000 PLN seem to
be smoking the most, and from there it decreases in both
directions. For age there is less influence except for the people with
low income. In this group, young people under 30 smoke much less than
those in their 40s, 50s and above. However, for all incomes there is a
little bump in smoking for people in their late 20s and people in
their 60s.
